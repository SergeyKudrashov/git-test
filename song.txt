I'm coming up only to hold you under
I'm coming up only to show you wrong
And to know you is hard, we wonder
To know you, all wrong we were

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Really too late to call, so
We wait for
Morning to wake you, that's all we got
To know me as hardly golden
Is to know me all wrong, they were

At every occasion, I'll be ready for the funeral
Every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
Every occasion, know I'm ready for the funeral
Every occasion, oh, one billion-day funeral
